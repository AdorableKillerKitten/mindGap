# mindGap
Trying to improve my JavaScript and Webdev knowledge by building a MindMapping tool, 
currently working on improving the backend mechanics, giving the user the ability to choose different  
shapes for the mindMap nodes, and improving the ui 
basically right now you can add nodes manually in the code, and reposition them own screen using the mouse 
works fine, and roughly in the way I intended it :) 

this is mostly for archiving, but if anyone stumbles across it any input is obviously appreciated :)
